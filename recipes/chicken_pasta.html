        <!-- Steps section -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook pasta according to package instructions, drain, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes. Place the flour in one dish, beaten eggs in the second, and breadcrumbs mixed with half of the Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning in the third.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken in the flour, dip it in the eggs, then coat it in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing to adhere.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the breaded chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Pour marinara sauce over the chicken and sprinkle with mozzarella and the remaining Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is baking, toss the cooked pasta with a little marinara sauce to coat.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the oven and serve it over the pasta. Garnish with fresh basil and more Parmesan, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
            </ol>
