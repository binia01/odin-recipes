    <!-- Steps section -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and mix until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Fold in the grated carrots, and if using, add the chopped nuts and raisins.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. In a large bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt, and continue beating until smooth and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost the top of one layer, stack the second layer on top, and frost the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with extra nuts if desired.</li>
    </ol>
